Section 3 
------------

Factors to consider when choosing AWS Region:
- Compliance with govt & legal reqs( Datat doesn't leave country)
- Latency: Proximity to Customers
- Available Services in a region: Every feature in every region
- Pricing( varies from region to region) 

AWS Availability Zones 
------------------------
 - Every region has 2-6(usually 3) avaiability zones (AZ)
 - Ex: Sydney AWS region: ap-southeast-2
	- ap-southeast-2a,2b,2c(3 total)
 - Each AZ has >=1 discrete data centers
	- Each DDC has redundant power, networking, & connectivity
	- Ex: 2a has 1 DDC, 2b has 2 DDC, 2b has 3 DDC
 - AWS doesn't disclose this info
 - Separate from each other
	- Helps isolate from disaster(if 2b goes down, 2a,c are fine)
 - Connected with high-bandwith, ultra-low latency linking
 - These 3 AZ's form a region
